A tiny collection of Python experiments, exercises, and one-off scripts created while learning. Nothing production-ready — just notes, examples, and fun tinkering. 🚀🐍

Short, self-contained .py files used to practice concepts and try ideas. Good for browsing, learning, and copying snippets.

Made with ❤️ and Python.
